This is my first exercise project after learning **DOM programming**, inspired by [worawaluns](https://dribbble.com/shots/2320805--Freebie-Calculator-UI-Sketch). It fits both mobile and desktop, including **CSS animation** at the same time.

Although jQuery is a powerful weapon and I once used it in this project, but finally I keep using javascript purely. There are two reasons:
1. I don't want to depend a library too much especially when learning basic skills.
2. jQuery may be outdated in some ways.

## Todo list
- [x] 在算式为空时禁止输入乘除
- [x] 点击等号之后再按数字键，清除原有的算式然后输入对应的数字
- [ ] 计算结果位数过长时的显示
- [x] 控制滚动条始终保持在底部，显示算式的末尾
- [ ] localStorage
