This is my first exercise project after learning **DOM programming**, inspired by [worawaluns](https://dribbble.com/shots/2320805--Freebie-Calculator-UI-Sketch). It is **responsive** designed, fitting both mobile and desktop. At the same time, **CSS animation** makes interactions more lively.

Although jQuery is handy and I once used it in this project, but finally I insisted using javascript purely. There are two reasons:

1. I don't want to depend a library too much especially when learning basic skills.  
2. jQuery may be outdated in some ways.

## Todo list
- [x] 在算式为空时禁止输入乘除
- [x] 点击等号之后再按数字键，清除原有的算式然后输入对应的数字
- [ ] 计算结果位数过长时的显示
- [x] 控制滚动条始终保持在底部，显示算式的末尾
- [ ] localStorage
